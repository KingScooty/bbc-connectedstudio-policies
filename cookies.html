  </p> 
  <h2>Performance cookies/analytics</h2>
  <p> 
  We use Performance cookies across BBC websites for internal purposes to help us to provide you with a better user experience. Information supplied by cookies helps us to understand how our visitors use BBC websites so that we can improve how we present our content to you. They also allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages. We generally contract with independent measurement and research companies to perform these services for us and when this is the case, these cookies may be set by a third party company (third party cookies). For example Google Analytics: This is web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics sets a cookie in order to evaluate use of those services and compile a report for us. Opt-out of Google Analytics cookies.

  <h2>Third party cookies</h2>
  <p>
  Where we partner with another company to produce BBC Connected Studios pilots, cookies may be set by that company. If this will occur for a particular pilot, we will let you know as part of information about that pilot.
  </p><p>
  We sometimes embed photos and video content from websites such as flickr and YouTube. Pages with this embedded content may present cookies from these websites. Similarly, when you use one of the share buttons on a BBC website, a cookie may be set by the service you have chosen to share content through. The BBC does not control the dissemination of these cookies and this tool will not block cookies from those websites. You should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.
  </p>
  <h2>Adobe Flash Player Cookies</h2>
  <p>
  The Adobe Flash Player, used to provide services such as iPlayer in your web browser or web-based games, is also capable of storing information on your device. However, these cookies cannot be controlled through your web browser. Some web browser manufacturers are developing solutions to allow you to control these through your browser, but at the present time, if you wish to restrict or block Flash Cookies, then you must do this on the Adobe website.
  </p><p>
  Please be aware that restricting the use of Flash Cookies may affect the features available to you, for example, the auto resume feature when watching BBC videos.
  </p>
  <h2>Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting</h2>

  <p>DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. This website does not currently respond to DNT requests, however, you may opt-out of tracking on this website, including analytics, by following the instructions to opt-out of cookies above.
  </p><p>
  A uniform standard has not yet been adopted to determine how DNT requests should be interpreted and what actions should be taken by websites and third parties. The BBC will continue to review DNT and other new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once available.
  </p>
  <h2>Similar technologies - Web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs</h2>
  <p> 
  These are all terms used to describe a particular form of technology implemented by many sites in order to help them to understand and analyse how their site is being used and, in turn, to improve your experience of the site. They may also be used to target any particular content being served on the web page you are viewing.
  </p><p> 
  A web beacon (or similar) usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email. They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when the page or email was viewed, from what device and which geo-location etc.
  </p><p> 
  As a web beacon forms part of a web page, it is not possible to â€˜opt-outâ€™ as such but you can render them ineffective by opting out of the cookies they set.
  </p> 
  <h2>Mobile device and TV apps</h2>

  <p>On devices such as mobile phones, tablets and smart TVs, instead of cookies, information collected from or stored to your device may be used to â€˜rememberâ€™ you or provide you with the content you have requested. For details on this, please see â€œMobile devices and TVsâ€ on <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/privacy/devices'>http://www.bbc.co.uk/privacy/devices</a>
